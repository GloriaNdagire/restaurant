<h1>Profesional Background</h1>
Glosh design started with only one sew machine as Gloria was working with a couple of other women,
She one time designed a beautiful dress that she liked and so decided to post it online, little did she
know that was her turning point. "Thank be to God" she emphasizes.

<h1>About gloshdesign</h1>
We currently do fashion and design for weddings or small functions such as birthdays or Baptism
In addition to that, we do pedicures and manicures for both men and women, however we are aspiring
to expanding our branches to mukono and acacia, plus adding "massage"to make it an all round Glosh design for you. <br><br>
